            edutubebd is one of the key initiative of Ethics Advanced Technology
            Limited (EATL) for the development of country’s education sector to
            change them in a different level. It is the only education portal
            focused on local context and syllabus. In this portal anyone can
            have an account or subscribe for free. Then any student, teachers,
            parents or guardians can log in to upload their education materials
            & anyone can download to access.
            <br />
            Online learning cannot replace traditional learning system in
            Bangladesh. It requires time. As a student’s original learning
            pattern in Bangladesh is material based. Therefore sharing is very
            important to step towards the change. Adoption of online learning
            process needs to start. Majority students of Bangladesh lacks from
            many education facilities, contents, lectures, notes, demonstration
            because of proper guidance, support & infrastructure. Few affluent
            students get touch of excellent education materials mostly in urban
            areas. With the help of technology, we can build a platform where
            these facilitated students, well known teachers will provide their
            materials absolutely free just to help & enhance another student who
            couldn't access it because of location & affordability.
            <br /> At present, students of the secondary, higher secondary or
            universities attend class lectures given by their class teachers or
            they take notes from private tutors, and in urban areas sometimes
            they share their electronic version of the content through emails or
            flash-drive. The exchange of contents remain in the close circle of
            students and the life cycle of the contents ends when the students
            move to new classes. Sometimes the lecture notes or books are kept
            at family level for the younger members in the family. However,
            these notes prepared with extensive labor, care, and attention could
            serve wider audiences and help other student better prepared their
            lessons. In this era of communication technology, there have been
            couple of alternative ways to help the students with their study in
            addition to the traditional teacher driven education systems. Among
            them, there are couple of ICT based solution such as Khan Academy,
            Udemy, etc. available which are suitable mostly for the students of
            the western countries. In Bangladesh, an ICT based educational
            content sharing platform is very essential which will focus on
            students and context of Bangladesh, and deliver contents to the
            students in different academic levels.
